# LinkedIn-Post-Scraper

![Web scraper](/Images/web-scraping.jpg)

What is this?:

    It's often seen that people want to share some content with the interested people on linkedin. But when
    many people put their emails on the comment section, it becomes impossible to send it to each of them.
    
    That's when the automation comes. 
    
    All we need is to put the url of the post and we can get all the emails to local storage.

Requirements:

    python3
    selenium
    pandas

Installation:

    sudo apt-get python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install selenium
    sudo pip3 install pandas

How to run this code
    
    Download the project and extract to local storage.
    Open script folder.
    Run linkedin.py in terminal.
